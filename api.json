      "full": "Inugami, literally 'dog god,' is one of the darker entities in Japanese folklore—a powerful spirit familiar created through a horrifically cruel ritual and bound to serve a sorcerer or family for generations. According to tradition, an inugami is created by burying a dog up to its neck, starving it while placing food just out of reach, and then beheading it at the peak of its frenzy and anguish. The head is then worshipped and becomes a powerful familiar spirit. Once created, an inugami possesses formidable supernatural abilities: it can possess humans (causing victims to bark, crawl on all fours, and crave raw meat), inflict illness and madness, protect its owning family from harm, curse enemies, and even divine the future. The spirit is bound to a family bloodline and passes through generations, creating what's known as 'inugami-mochi'—families possessing an inugami. This designation carried severe social stigma in certain regions, particularly Shikoku and Kyushu. While inugami can be tremendously beneficial to their masters, they are also dangerous—if not properly respected, fed, and cared for, they can turn on their own family. Removal of inugami possession requires difficult exorcism rituals. The creation method is considered extremely cruel and has long been a forbidden practice, yet the folklore reflects deep cultural beliefs about the power of suffering, the bond between humans and dogs, and the moral consequences of dark sorcery."
