## Overview

Inugami, literally "dog god," is one of the darker entities in Japanese folklore—a powerful spirit familiar created through a horrifically cruel ritual and bound to serve a sorcerer or family for generations.

According to tradition, an inugami is created by burying a dog up to its neck, starving it while placing food just out of reach, and then beheading it at the peak of its frenzy and anguish. The head is then worshipped and becomes a powerful familiar spirit.

Once created, an inugami possesses formidable supernatural abilities: it can possess humans, inflict illness and madness, protect its owning family, curse enemies, and even divine the future. The spirit is bound to a family bloodline and passes through generations.

While inugami can be tremendously beneficial to their masters, they are also dangerous—if not properly respected and cared for, they can turn on their own family.

## Creation (Forbidden Practice)

### The Ritual ⚠️

**WARNING**: This ritual is **forbidden and extremely cruel**. It is documented for cultural understanding only.

**Traditional Method**:
1. Bury a dog up to its neck in the ground
2. Place food just out of reach
3. Starve the dog while it suffers in sight of food
4. At the peak of its frenzy, anguish, and resentment
5. Behead the dog
6. Worship the severed head
7. The head becomes an inugami spirit

**The Dark Logic**:
- Extreme suffering creates powerful resentment
- Resentment and loyalty combine to create familiar
- The dog's rage is directed by the sorcerer
- Cruelty binds the spirit through trauma

**Moral Status**: This practice is **universally condemned as cruel and forbidden**. It reflects historical dark sorcery traditions but is recognized as morally reprehensible.
